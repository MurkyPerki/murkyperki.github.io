# Game Design Concepts

Concept pitches, drawings, and references I use to explore ideas and player experience.

## Slime Boss Mass & Health Concept

The idea: a slime boss whose health is its mass. As it loses mass, it becomes faster,
more aggressive, and changes its attack patterns.

Early sketches focus on clearly showing mass changes to the player so they can
understand when the boss is entering a new phase.

## Concept PowerPoint

My concept pitch about my 3 concepts: **Mass Of Slime**, **Tokyo Park**, **Meandering Siege**.
