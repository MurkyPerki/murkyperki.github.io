lessons:
  - Isolating one mechanic at a time makes it easier to iterate on feel.
  - Small throwaway prototypes are a good way to test ideas before committing to full projects.

This page collects a few gameplay and tech experiments from unfinished projects – things like dash feel, enemy behaviour, and combat readability.  
They’re not full games on their own, but they show how I iterate on mechanics before building them into something larger.
